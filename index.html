  <div class="panel">Over the years, sharks have gotten a bad rap as bloodthirsty man-eaters. We challenge you to take a second look at these magnificent creatures and to fight fear with facts. Here are five reasons to re-think the shark—even the great white, a species that has starred in our horror movies and collective nightmares for decades. It’s time for us to embrace the fact that there’s far more to sharks than their bite.</div>
  <div class="panel">
    <h1> Respect your elders</h1>
    <p>In fact, your chances of being the victim of an unprovoked shark encounter are lower than your chances of being struck by lightning, injured in a hunting accident, or even attacked by a domestic dog. Even though the odds are in your favor, sharks are wild animals that must be respected when encountered<p>
      
    </div>
  
  <div class="panel">Jaws really did a number on the way we think of sharks. And yes, they are creatures that have evolved over 450 million years to be perfect killing machines. They’re apex predators that hunt the ocean without fear of anything other than maybe the errant killer whale with a taste for shark liver. And we, with our tiny flailing legs and arms, dull teeth, and weak nails, are no match for one. The news doesn’t help, either — if it bleeds it leads, and shark attacks are bloody — and every shark attack is relentlessly reported on by outlets chasing the almighty click. Thankfully, we have brains large enough to create things to protect ourselves and opposable thumbs, otherwise we’d be on the menu instead of the ones writing it. But should we really be afraid of sharks? You already know the answer: absolutely not.</div>
  
  
  <div class="panel">By most estimates, humans kill somewhere around 100 million sharks a year. That’s about 11,000 an hour. Let that sink in for a second. In the time it took you to make breakfast, eat, and wash the dishes this morning, 11,000 sharks perished. Eleven thousand more will perish in the next hour after that, and the next one and the next one and the next one. Every single hour of every day for an entire year. According to the International Shark Attack File (ISAF), in 2020 there were 129 shark attacks. Fifty-seven of those were unprovoked, and there were 13 fatalities. In the world. And although that number is up from the average, the average number is four fatal attacks globally each year.</div>
  <div class="panel">So if you’re in that scared-of-sharks club, I get it. Your fear is okay. But it helps to remember that it’s not sharks that are scary — it’s your idea of what a shark could do. Remember, though, that your chances of actually being attacked by a shark, even if you see one in the lineup, are infinitesimally small and that we, with our big brains and opposable thumbs, are the scariest ones. We need sharks to keep our oceans healthy, after all, and our irrational fear of sharks won’t lead anywhere good.</div>
